Description: Functions for generating tables required for drawing and calculating hypsometric curves and hypsometric integrals.
    These functions accept as input the DEM of the region of interest (your watershed) and a spatial data frame file specifying delineation of sub-catchments within the watershed.
    They then generate output in the form of PNG images and HTML files contained in a folder named "HYPSO_OUTPUT" created in the current directory.
